3D Printing Log

January 1, 2024
NOTES: Had difficulty getting my reel side plates (open weave) to stick, it’s cold in my office today, so I increased the bed temp to 65°C for the first layer and then back to 55° for the rest of the print.

NOTES: New filament - Proto-Pasta matte black HTPLA. I really like this stuff, beautiful matte black finish and prints nicely
